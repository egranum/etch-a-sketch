TOP etch-a-sketch project

In this project I am doing this https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project assignment at The Odin Project.

The task is building a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch using CSS and JavaScript
